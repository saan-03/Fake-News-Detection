**Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning**

**Project Overview
**
This project implements a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake. Using a dataset of labeled news articles, the model applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a Passive Aggressive Classifier to efficiently detect misinformation. The tool enhances the reliability of news sources by automating the identification of fake news.

Key Features
Dataset Preparation & Processing

Reads and processes a dataset of news articles stored in a CSV file.
Extracts text content and corresponding labels (Fake or Real).
Splits the data into training and testing sets (80-20 split) for model evaluation.
Text Vectorization Using TF-IDF

Utilizes TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into numerical representations.
Removes common English stop words to improve classification accuracy.
Limits the maximum document frequency to filter out overly common words.
Model Training & Evaluation

Trains a Passive Aggressive Classifier, a fast and efficient linear model for binary classification.
Evaluates the model using accuracy score and a confusion matrix.
Determines how well the model distinguishes between fake and real news.
Performance Metrics & Insights

Displays accuracy results for model validation.
Analyzes the confusion matrix to measure false positives and false negatives.
Provides insights into model strengths and areas for improvement.
Impact & Benefits
Automated Misinformation Detection: Helps users verify the credibility of news articles.
Fast & Scalable Processing: Can analyze large volumes of text efficiently.
Improved Media Literacy: Supports efforts to combat fake news and promote reliable information.
Real-World Applicability: Can be integrated into fact-checking systems or media monitoring tools.
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in detecting fake news, offering a foundation for further improvements and deployment in real-world applications.
